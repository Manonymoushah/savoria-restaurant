# ✅ YOUR BACKEND IS ALREADY SET UP!

## 🎉 Good News!

Your backend is **100% ready** and fully configured! Here's the proof:

### What's Already Done:

✅ **server.js** - 458 lines of Node.js backend code  
✅ **package.json** - All dependencies listed  
✅ **node_modules/** - Dependencies installed (220 packages)  
✅ **savoria.db** - SQLite database created (28KB)  
✅ **.env** - Email configuration file exists  
✅ **api-test.html** - API testing page ready

---

## 🚀 How to Use Your Backend

### **STEP 1: Start the Server**

Open a terminal and run ONE of these commands:

```bash
# Option A: Using NPM
npm start

# Option B: Using Node directly
node server.js

# Option C: Using the start script
./start.sh
```

You should see this output:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║   🍽️  SAVORIA RESTAURANT BACKEND  🍽️      ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝

✅ Server running on http://localhost:3000
✅ Database: SQLite (savoria.db)
✅ API endpoints available at /api/*
```

**⚠️ Keep this terminal open!** The server needs to keep running.

---

### **STEP 2: Verify It's Working**

**Method 1: Run the verification script**

```bash
# In a NEW terminal window:
./verify-backend.sh
```

**Method 2: Test with curl**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

You should get:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "message": "Savoria backend is running" }
```

**Method 3: Open in browser** (EASIEST!)

```
http://localhost:3000/api-test.html
```

---

### **STEP 3: Test Your API**

I've already opened the API test page in your Simple Browser!

**What you can test:**

1. **Health Check** - Click "Test Health Check"

   - Should show: `{"status":"ok","message":"Savoria backend is running"}`

2. **Create Reservation** - Fill the form and click "Create Reservation"

   - Should return a confirmation number like: `SAV-000001`

3. **Submit Contact Form** - Fill and submit

   - Should show: `{"success":true,"message":"Message sent successfully!"}`

4. **Newsletter Subscribe** - Enter email

   - Should show: `{"success":true,"message":"Successfully subscribed!"}`

5. **Get All Reservations** - Click "Fetch All Reservations"
   - Should show all the test reservations you created

## 📊 View Your Database

Want to see the actual data stored?

```bash
# Open SQLite database
sqlite3 savoria.db

# View all tables
.tables

# See reservations
SELECT * FROM reservations;

# See contact submissions
SELECT * FROM contact_submissions;

# See newsletter subscribers
SELECT * FROM newsletter_subscribers;

# Exit
.exit
```

## 🌐 Access Your Full Website

Once the server is running, open:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

This will show your complete restaurant website, and now **all the forms actually work**!

Try it:

1. Go to **Reservations page**
2. Fill out the form
3. Click "Reserve Table"
4. You'll get a confirmation number!
5. Open `api-test.html` and click "Fetch All Reservations"
6. **Your reservation is saved in the database!** 🎉

## 📧 Email Configuration (Optional)

Your backend can send emails, but you need to configure it:

1. **Open the `.env` file** (already exists!)

   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

2. **Add your Gmail credentials:**

   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   RESTAURANT_EMAIL=restaurant@savoria.com
   ```

3. **Get Gmail App Password:**

   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Enable 2-Factor Authentication first
   - Create an "App Password"
   - Copy and paste it into `.env`

4. **Restart the server**
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   # Then start again:
   npm start
   ```

Now when someone makes a reservation, they'll get a confirmation email! 📧

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Port 3000 already in use"

```bash
# Kill the process using port 3000
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000)

# Then start again
npm start
```

### "Cannot find module"

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Then start
npm start
```

### "Database is locked"

```bash
# Stop the server
# Delete the database
rm savoria.db
