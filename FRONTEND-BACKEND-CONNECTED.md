# ✅ FRONTEND NOW CONNECTED TO BACKEND!

## 🎉 What I Just Fixed

You were **100% correct** - the backend was working but the frontend forms weren't actually sending data to it. I've now connected everything!

---

## 🔗 What's Now Connected

### ✅ **Pages Updated to Use Backend:**

1. **Reservations Page** (`pages/reservations.html`)

   - Form now submits to `/api/reservations`
   - Gets real confirmation number from database
   - Shows loading state while submitting
   - Displays success with backend confirmation

2. **Contact Page** (`pages/contact.html`)

   - Form submits to `/api/contact`
   - Saves to database
   - Shows loading spinner
   - Resets form on success

3. **Homepage Newsletter** (`index.html` via `js/script.js`)

   - Newsletter form submits to `/api/newsletter/subscribe`
   - Checks for duplicate emails
   - Shows confetti on success

4. **Events Page** (`pages/events.html`)
   - Event inquiry form submits to `/api/events/inquiry`
   - Saves all event details to database
   - Shows loading state

## 📊 NEW: Admin Dashboard!

I created a **beautiful admin dashboard** where you can view ALL your data!

**Access it at:**

```
http://localhost:3000/admin-dashboard.html
```

### What the Dashboard Shows:

✅ **Statistics Cards** - Total counts of everything  
✅ **Reservations Table** - All reservations with details  
✅ **Contact Submissions** - All contact form messages  
✅ **Newsletter Subscribers** - All email subscribers  
✅ **Event Inquiries** - All event booking requests

### Features:

- 🔄 Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- 🎨 Beautiful design matching your restaurant theme
- 📱 Responsive (works on mobile)
- 🔍 See all data in one place

## 🔧 Alternative Backend Viewers

Besides the admin dashboard I created, you can also use:

### **Option 1: DB Browser for SQLite** (Best GUI)

**Install:**

```bash
sudo apt install sqlitebrowser
```

**Open your database:**

```bash
sqlitebrowser savoria.db
```

This gives you a full GUI to:

- View all tables
- Run SQL queries
- Edit data
- Export to CSV

### **Option 2: SQLite Command Line**

```bash
# Open database
sqlite3 savoria.db

# View all tables
.tables

# See all reservations
SELECT * FROM reservations;

# See latest 5 reservations
SELECT * FROM reservations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

# Count total reservations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reservations;

# See all contact submissions
SELECT * FROM contact_submissions;

# See all newsletter subscribers
SELECT * FROM newsletter_subscribers;

# See all event inquiries
SELECT * FROM event_inquiries;

# Exit
.exit
```

### **Option 3: VS Code Extension**

Install "SQLite" extension in VS Code:

1. Click Extensions icon
2. Search "SQLite"
3. Install "SQLite" by alexcvzz
4. Right-click `savoria.db` → "Open Database"
5. Click "SQLITE EXPLORER" in sidebar

### **Option 4: Online SQL Viewer**

Upload your `savoria.db` file to:

- https://sqliteonline.com/
- https://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/
